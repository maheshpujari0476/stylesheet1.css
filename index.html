        <p><strong>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu</strong> MC (born<strong>Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu,</strong>Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒi.u]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother Teresa,[a] was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. Born in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman Empire,[b] at the age of 18 she moved to Ireland and later to India, where she lived most of her life. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised by the Catholic Church as<strong>Saint Teresa of Calcutta</strong>. The anniversary of her death, 5 September, is her feast day.</p>

          <br> <p> Mother Teresa founded<i>Missionaries of Charity,</i> a <i>religious congregation,</i> which grew to have over 4,500 nuns across 133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes for people who are <strong>dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis.</strong> The congregation also runs <i> soup kitchens,</i> dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as<i> orphanages and schools.</i> Members take vows of <i>chastity, poverty, and obedience</i> and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."[7]</p><br>
            
            Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962<strong>Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize</strong> and the 1979<strong> Nobel Peace Prize.</strong> A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and contraception, as well as the poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography, written by<strong> Navin Chawla,</strong> was published in 1992, and she has been the subject of many other works. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta</p>
