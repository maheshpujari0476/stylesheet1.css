  <center><h1><big><b>She Showed Us The True Meaning of Charity</b></big></h1></center>

<hr>
<ol>
    <li>Many of us dreamed of changing the world, but only very few chose to act on it. And fewer still did it as bravely as this humble woman from Calcutta.

    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Her genuine desire to serve the poor is what propelled her to pursue this path. If you look at all her humanitarian efforts, her motivations are clear as day. She set up soup kitchens, a leper colony, orphanages, and a home for the dying destitute.</li>
    <br>
    <li>She treated the lepers, educated the poorest of the poor, and fed the homeless. She treated them like her family. All the criticisms and sly comments against her did nothing to extinguish the passion in her heart.

    </li>
    <br>
    <li>This selfless dedication flamed the fans of charitable awareness around the world. Many were inspired and joined Mother Teresa in her mission.</li>
  <br>
    <li>She could have chosen to ignore her calling, but she didn’t. Her decision to exchange a life of comfort with that of poverty earned her the world’s admiration. This act of hers showed the world that material things won’t bring happiness as much as helping others.</li>
<br>
</ol>
<hr>

<center><h2><b>Universal Love</b></h2></center>
<hr>
<ol>

    <li>Aside from her passion for serving the poor, Mother Teresa changed the world and also inspired us by showing what universal love means.</li>
    <br>
    <li>he didn’t care if someone was white, black, brown, yellow, young, old, male, or female. In the summer of 1982, she even went to Beirut to help both Christian and Muslim children.</li>
    <br>
    <li>At a time when people with HIV/AIDS were looked down on, her universal love lifted them up. She set up Gift of Love, a home that cares for those infected with the disease.</li>
   <br>
    <li>She was even quoted saying:

        “When you judge someone, you have no time to love them.”
        
        </li>
    <li>Universal love became one of the core principles of The Missionaries of Charity which has now more than 5,000 members in various countries across the globe.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<center><h2><b>Promoting Peace and Forgiveness</b>
</h2></center>
<hr>

<ol>

    <li>Another way in which Mother Teresa changed the world was by promoting peace and forgiveness. She believed peace began with a smile and lived by this philosophy daily. She worked tirelessly to bridge gaps in a world filled with conflicts and divisions. She promoted harmony among different communities.

    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Mother Teresa’s efforts were particularly evident during times of crisis and conflict. For instance, during the 1992-1993 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, she visited the country and contacted both sides. She offered support and compassion to everyone affected by the violence. Her presence and words brought hope and healing to many.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Through her actions, Mother Teresa taught us the power of forgiveness. She believed forgiving others brings inner peace and helps build a compassionate, united society. By forgiving those who wronged her or the Missionaries of Charity, she showed us that forgiveness can transform lives. That it can mend broken relationships.

    </li>
    <br>
    <li>She spoke out against societal injustices and fought for the rights of the marginalized and oppressed. Mother Teresa believed that no one should be treated as less than human. She dedicated her life to ensuring everyone received love, care, and respect.

    </li>
    <br>
    <Li>Her work with the poor, the sick, and the dying was a testament to her commitment to upholding human dignity. She taught us that everyone deserves to be seen, heard, and valued, regardless of background or condition</Li>
