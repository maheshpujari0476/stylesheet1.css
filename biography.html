           <p> Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha)[8][page needed] Bojaxhiu (Anjezë is a cognate of Agnes; Gonxhe means "flower bud" Albanian).[9] She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family[10][11][12] in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia).[13][14].
            She was baptised in Skopje the day after her birth.[8] She later considered 27 August, the day she was baptised, her "true birthday".[13]</p>



           <p> She was the youngest child of Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).[15] Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman North Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old.[13][c] He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day Albania).[16][17] Her mother may have been from a village near Gjakova,[18] believed by her offspring to be Bishtazhin.</p>

             <p><h>According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Anjezë was in her early years when she became fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life.[20] Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimage</h></p>


            <p><h>Anjezë left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of the Sisters of Loreto in India.[22] She saw neither her mother nor her sister again.[23] Her family lived in Skopje until 1934, when they moved to Tirana.</h></p>


              <p><h>She arrived in India in 1929[25] and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas,[26] where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent.[27] She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries;[28][29] because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish spelling of Teresa</h></p>


              <p><h>Teresa took her solemn vows on 14 May 1937 while she was a teacher at the Loreto convent school in Entally, eastern Calcutta, taking the style of 'Mother' as part of Loreto custom.[13][31][32] She served there for nearly twenty years and was appointed its headmistress in 1944.[33] Although Mother Teresa enjoyed teaching at the school, she was increasingly disturbed by the poverty surrounding her in Calcutta.[34] The Bengal famine of 1943 brought misery and death to the city, and the August 1946 Direct Action Day began a period of Muslim-Hindu violence</h></p>



                <p><h>In 1946, during a visit to Darjeeling by train, Mother Teresa felt that she heard the call of her inner conscience to serve the poor of India for Jesus. She asked for and received permission to leave the school. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, choosing a white sari with two blue borders as the order's habit.</h></p><br>

                <p><h>On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith."[36] Joseph Langford later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become Mother Teresa<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Memorial_house_of_Mother_Teresa.jpg" height="100" width="100"><h>She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,[25] replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.[38][39] She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and hungry.[40] At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".</h></p>
                
                

                <p><h>Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister.[42] Mother Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulty. With no income, she begged for food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of convent life during these early months:</h></p>
       
       
       
       
                <p><h>Our Lord wants me to be a free nun covered with the poverty of the cross. Today, I learned a good lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home I walked and walked till my arms and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body and soul, looking for a home, food and health. Then, the comfort of Loreto [her former congregation] came to tempt me. "You have only to say the word and all that will be yours again", the Tempter kept on saying. ... Of free choice, my God, and out of love for you, I desire to remain and do whatever be your Holy will in my regard. I did not let a single tear come</h></p>
       
       
       
                <p><h>On 7 October 1950, Mother Teresa received Vatican permission for the diocesan congregation, which would become the Missionaries of Charity.[44] In her words, it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone".[45]

                  In 1952, Mother Teresa opened her first hospice with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an abandoned Hindu temple into the Kalighat Home for the Dying, free for the poor, and renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).[46] Those brought to the home received medical attention and the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their faith: Muslims were read the Quran, Hindus received water from the Ganges, and Catholics received extreme unction.[47] "A beautiful death", Mother Teresa said, "is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted</h></p>
